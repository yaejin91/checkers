Load File: (Already in the source code folder) samplemoves2.txt

1. If you want to play a different set of moves, place the moves text file directly inside the src, NOT inside the checkers package folder.

2. You have to hardcode in the file name if you want to choose a different moves file.
On line 15 in Board.java, change "src/samplemoves2.txt" to "src/yourownfile.txt"

Other Instructions: I didn't have time to implement code where the parsed text file is free from extra blanks (spaces and enters). If you do use your own moves file, please get rid of the blanks in your own text file on your own if needed before running the program.
